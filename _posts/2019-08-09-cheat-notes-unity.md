###### What we need to define for a basic machine leaning applying?

- what is the input data from which we want to extract information(model)?
- what kind of model is most appropriate for this data?
- what kind of answer would we like to elicit from new data based on this model?

if we can answer these three questions, we can set up a machine learning workflow hat will build our model and produce our desired answer.

##### Concepts we need to be aware of the practice machine learning

<u>Scalar</u>: is synonymous with the term variable and is a storage location paired 			with a symbolic name. This storage location holds an unknown quantity of 			information called a value.

<u>Vectors</u>: For our use, we will define a vector as: 	

â€‹	For a positive integer n, a vector is an n-tuple, ordered (multi)set or array of n 	number, called elements or scalar.

<u>Matrices</u>: Consider a matrix as a group of vectors that all have the same dimension (number of columns). In this way is a two-dimensional  array for which we have rows and columns. if our matrix is said to be an `n x m` matrix, it has n rows and m columns.

<u>Tensor</u>: A tensor is a multidimensional array at the most fundamental level. It is a more general mathematical structure than a vector.

with tensor, the rows extend along the y-axis and the columns along the x-axis. Each axis is a dimension, and tensor have additional dimensions. Tensor also have a rank. Comparatively, a Scalar is of rank 0 and a vector is rank 1. We also see that a matrix is a rank 2. Any entity of rank 3 of above is considered a tensor.
